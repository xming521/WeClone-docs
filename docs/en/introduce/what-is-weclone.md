# WeClone: A One-Stop Solution for Creating Digital Avatars from Your Chat History

Have you ever imagined what it would be like if an AI could learn your chat style, your catchphrases, and even your unique expressions to "replicate" you in the digital world? [WeClone](https://github.com/xming521/WeClone) is an experiment born from this vision.

WeClone is a one-stop solution for creating digital avatars from chat history. By fine-tuning a large language model with your chat records, it enables the model to speak in your "voice" and integrates it with chatbots to create your very own digital twin.

> ##### Bots fine-tuned with WeClone are deployed in our [Community Resources](./community-resources.md). For more interesting case studies, you can also visit our [Xiaohongshu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/628109730000000021029de4).

> [!NOTE]
> We're looking for interesting examples of native English speakers chatting with WeClone!
> Feel free to share them with us on Twitter.

::: tip
The WeClone project is still under rapid iteration, and the current results are not final.
The effectiveness of fine-tuning is influenced by many factors, such as the model's parameter size, and the volume and quality of the dialogue data. Generally, **the larger the model parameters, the more dialogue data, and the more consistent the expression style, the closer the fine-tuned dialogue effect will be to the original personality traits**.
